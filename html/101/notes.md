# HTML 101

## HTML forms the structure of all web pages.

HTML -> hyper text markup language

The `<head>` tag configures the page and is not rendered by the browser.
The `<title>` contains the name of the page and is rendered in the browsers tab.
Tag that have opening and closing elements are known as container elements.
Tags that do not have opening and closing elements are called self-closing tags ('/>).
To make reading an HTML file easier, lines are nested within their parent element.
Browsers read HTML and, in a sense, HTML is like a big, long string.
Browsers can read files or you can start a server in VS Code with **Go Live**.
