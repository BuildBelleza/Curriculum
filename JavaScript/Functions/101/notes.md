# Javascript Functions 101

## A general overview

**Any and all functions, in any language you use, does 2 things. It either returns something, or it does something (and doesn't return anything).**

### Terms

**anonymous function**

**argument**

**call**
An action which executes (or fires) the function.

**callback function**

**function**
There are two contexts. One is the function definition itself. Another is the code within the definition which executes when called and which sometimes returns a value.

**function body**
Contains the code of the function itself within a set of curly braces.

**function declaration**
Uses the _function_ keyword to declare a named function. The name of the function immediately follows the _function_ keyword.

**function expression**

**hoisting**

**IIFE**

**named function**

**parameter**

**parentheses**
The parentheses have two purposes. One is to execute a function. Another is part of the syntax to define a function. In the former, it may contain arguments. In the later, it may contain parameters.

**return**
If implemented, it executes the last line of a functions code. It precedes a data type or a collection to be returned. We say that a functions closes or exits when the code that follows _return_ executes which also means that any lines beneath it are ignored.

**scope**
