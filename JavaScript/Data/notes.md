# Javascript Data 101
## Writing data to memory in JavaScript can be done with one of three keywords.

'var'
'''
var name = 'Paul';
'''
older and can get the same out of the bottom two options, not recommended

'let'
'''
let name = 'Paul';
'''
allows a reassignment of the variable, allows variable to change
example would be:
...
let name = 'Paul';
name = 'Paula'; (reassignment - this is allowed)
...

'const'
'''
const name = 'Paul';
name = 'Paula'; (reassignment - this is not allowed)
'''
short for constant, does not allow reassignment option/value never changes
