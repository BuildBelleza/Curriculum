# API 303 HTTP request methods
## There are many different types of HTTP requests. But you will mainly deal with just 5 of them.

### Common HTTP request methods:

**`POST`**
to create new data

**`PUT`**
to update data by overwriting everything in the data set

**`GET`**
to retrieve data

**`PATCH`**
to update data by overwriting only a part of the larger data set

**`DELETE`**
to delete date

Note: `PATCH` and `PUT` are similiar but our practices will concentrate on `PUT`.

There are about 40 or so methods to choose from... can be found on the MDN website. We will be only covering 5 of them.
